My name is Nellwyn Alexandra Thomas, but you can call me Nell. 

I work with data, I lead teams, and I do my best to leave things better than I found them.

Here is my path in this world so far:  

* 1983: Hello world!
* 1983-1993: The adorable years (as told by family)
* 1993-2001: The awkward years (as experienced by myself)
* 2001-2005: The Harvard years. I studied social psychology and cognitive neuroscience, working in clinical laboratories, learning stats and experimental design. I also helped run Harvard Model Congress, providing a place for US high school students to learn about (and simulate) civic involvement and government function. My undergraduate thesis on the affect of affirmative action policies on admission decision making won the Hoopes Prize, and I graduated magna cum laude with highest honers and as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. 
* 2005-2009: The early years. I worked in equity research and learned to write SQL, build models and write reports for non-technical audiences. I left equity research for a five person tech start-up, where I learned how to add value when there is no data around, and get things done with very little resources. 
* 2009-2011: The UPenn years. Inspired (and scared) by the rapid changes in internet technology I saw in industry, I started a PhD program in the History and Sociology of Science and Technology to better understand the social and historical context of technological disruption. I studied the history of early computing and the history of psychological experimentation on humans during the Cold War. Loving the learnings but missing the collaboration of teams and the pace of industry, I left with my master's, and a deep appreciation for the academics who help us understand our present through the past.
* 2011-2015: The Etsy years. What a joy. This company that builds amazing technology, a platform to connect buyers and sellers, with a mission that empowers artisans, craftspeople and micro businesses to flourish. I started as a revenue analyst, and over four years built, hired, and grew the analytics team. I reported to the CFO, worked on the IPO, and learned from the best.
* 2015-2016: The HFA years.
* 2017-now: The Facebook years.
