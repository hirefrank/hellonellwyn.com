**Hi!** I'm Nell.  I believe in the power of data to drive incredible progress. I pride myself on an obsession with building strong foundations, making the complex leigible, and fostering a culture of action. 

Currently, I serve as the **VP of Data at Shopify**, where I oversee the data science, data engineering, and data infrastructure organization.

Prior to Shopify, I served as the **Chief Technology Officer at the Democratic National Committee (DNC)**, where I led the team responsible for [cybersecurity](/talks#active-measures-disinformation-campaigns-and-election-security), [product development](/talks#dncs-new-tech-leader-talks-about-what-went-wrong-in-2016-and-how-dems-are-preparing-for-2020), and the [data infrastructure](/talks#data-should-enfranchise-people-says-the-democrats-head-of-technology) used to support democratic campaigns nationwide. My background also includes leadership roles at **Facebook**, where I led data science teams for the advertising ecosystem, **Hillary for America**, where I served as Deputy Chief Analytics Officer, and **Etsy** where I built the data team from the ground up and helped take the company public. 

I hold a degree in **Social Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience from Harvard** and an **M.A. in the History and Sociology of Science from the University of Pennsylvania**.

I live in **Brooklyn** with [Frank](https://hirefrank.com/).
